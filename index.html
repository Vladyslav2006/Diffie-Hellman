  <h2>Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm</h2>
  <p><strong>Diffie-Hellman</strong> is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. It was invented by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976.</p>

  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>The Diffie-Hellman algorithm was the first practical method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over an untrusted communication channel. It laid the foundation for modern public-key cryptography.</p>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Diffie-Hellman allows two parties to agree on a shared secret key, which can then be used for secure communication.</li>
    <li>It relies on the difficulty of solving discrete logarithms in a finite field, which makes it computationally infeasible to deduce the shared key without knowing certain private information.</li>
    <li>The process involves the exchange of public parameters (a large prime number and a base) between the parties.</li>
    <li>Each party selects a private key and computes a public key, which they exchange. The shared secret is then derived independently by both parties, but it is computationally infeasible for an attacker to deduce it.</li>
  </ul>
